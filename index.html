                <h3>Palestine Support & Relief Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        Palestine Support & Relief Project™ is a Washington Palestine association that will raise financial support to humanitarian causes for Palestinian civilians in the Gaza strip. We will also provide live informations about the conflict occuring between Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. We will provide reliable information about the technicalities of the war while accurately classifying all claims of the war.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Our Contribution to Palestine</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to our location in the United States, we gain access to many information from both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel influence. This open access allows us to derive objective statements while proving/denying claims. We will, in long-term, create a repository of accurate information, a repository debunking or proving certain claims, and a repository about ongoing news in Palestinian territories and Israel. In Washington, we will also physically provide fundraising for civilians, and will provide links to donate in another tab (top of the page).
                    </p>
